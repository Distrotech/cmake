{"name":"Cmake","tagline":"Mirror of git://cmake.org/cmake.git","body":"This is CMake, the cross-platform, open-source make system.\r\nCMake is distributed under the BSD License, see Copyright.txt.\r\nFor documentation see the Docs/ directory once you have built CMake\r\nor visit http://www.cmake.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding CMake\r\n==============\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Platforms\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nMS Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, IRIX, BeOS, QNX\r\n\r\nOther UNIX-like operating systems may work too out of the box, if not\r\nit shouldn't be a major problem to port CMake to this platform. Contact the\r\nCMake mailing list in this case: http://www.cmake.org/mailman/listinfo/cmake\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't have any previous version of CMake already installed\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* UNIX/Mac OSX/MinGW/MSYS/Cygwin:\r\n\r\nYou need to have a compiler and a make installed.\r\nRun the bootstrap script you find the in the source directory of CMake.\r\nYou can use the --help option to see the supported options.\r\nYou may want to use the --prefix=<install_prefix> option to specify a custom\r\ninstallation directory for CMake. You can run the bootstrap script from\r\nwithin the CMake source directory or any other build directory of your\r\nchoice. Once this has finished successfully, run make and make install.\r\nSo basically it's the same as you may be used to from autotools-based\r\nprojects:\r\n\r\n$ ./bootstrap; make; make install\r\n\r\n\r\n* Other Windows:\r\n\r\nYou need to download and install a binary release of CMake in order to build\r\nCMake.  You can get these releases from\r\nhttp://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html .  Then proceed with the instructions\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou already have a version of CMake installed\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can build CMake as any other project with a CMake-based build system:\r\nrun the installed CMake on the sources of this CMake with your preferred\r\noptions and generators. Then build it and install it.\r\nFor instructions how to do this, see http://www.cmake.org/HTML/RunningCMake.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
