The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.  By
default it is empty.  It is especially useful when cross-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
|CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX|.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per-call basis.  By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH
the search order will be as described above.  If
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be
used.  If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
directories will be searched.
