cmake-policies(7)
*****************

Policies in CMake are used to preserve backward compatible behavior
across multiple releases.  When a new policy is introduced, newer CMake
versions will begin to warn about the backward compatible behavior.  It
is possible to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or
backward compatible behavior using the cmake_policy() command.  It is
also possible to request NEW, or non-backward compatible behavior for a
policy, also avoiding the warning.

The cmake_minimum_required() command does more than report an error if
a too-old version of CMake is used to build a project.  It also sets
all policies introduced in that CMake version or earlier to NEW
behavior.

The CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION variable may also be used to
determine whether to report an error on use of deprecated macros or
functions.
